"AMERICA'S party conventions got under way in Cleveland on July 18th. Ever since 1972, when the Republicans began scripting their speeches with evening television audiences in mind, the quadrennial gatherings have been tightly stage-managed. Journalists and political junkies hoped that this year's Republican shindig would be the first convention with the nominee in doubt since 1980, when Ted Kennedy tried in vain to unseat the incumbent Democratic president Jimmy Carter. As it happened, Donald Trump managed to secure a comfortable majority of pledged delegates. Nonetheless, the convention's first day still offered a bit of suspense, when the #NeverTrump faction made a last-minute effort to register a protest. There was also a cringe-worthy moment when Melania Trump, the nominee's wife, repeated numerous phrases verbatim that Michelle Obama had used in her 2008 convention speech about her husband."
